## Hi there ðŸ‘‹ <img align="right" alt="Profile Hits" src="https://komarev.com/ghpvc/?username=iposho&style=flat-square">

I have over 15 years of experience delivering high-quality, user-centric web applications.

In my current role as a lead frontend engineer, I have successfully managed large-scale projects and led cross-functional teams to deliver exceptional results. I am constantly seeking new challenges and opportunities to grow both personally and professionally.

When I'm not coding, you can find me hiking, trying out new coffee shops, or attending tech meetups. I am always eager to learn and stay up-to-date on the latest industry trends and technologies.

Fun fact: I was involved in a company takeover process, and the company I worked for was also taken over in a year.
